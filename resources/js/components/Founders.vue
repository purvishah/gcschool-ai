          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">SHETH G.C. HIGH SCHOOL, Pilvai is named after the two brothers, Sheth Girdharlal Nihalchand and Sheth Chunilal Nihalchand. Founders of the institute in 1927, both were natives of Pilvai from a Vaishnav family, known for their lifelong commitment to social service and philanthropyâ€”supporting health, education, community services, agriculture, and religious causes. The family's descendants were recognized by the Gayakwad Sarkar in the Gayakwadi state for their charitable contributions and social amenities.</p>
