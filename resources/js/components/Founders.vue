          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The founders of this esteemed institution, <strong>Sheth Girdharlal Nihalchand</strong> and <strong>Sheth Chunilal Nihalchand</strong>, were proud natives of the village of Pilvai and laid the foundation of the school in 1927. Belonging to a respected Vaishnav family, both brothers were blessed with exceptional qualities of leadership, generosity, and deep commitment to the welfare of society. They dedicated their lives to social service, contributing selflessly to noble causes in diverse areas such as education, healthcare, agriculture, community development, and religious activities.</p> 
          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Their philanthropic spirit was widely recognized, and the descendants of the family were honored by the Gayakwad Sarkar of the Gaekwadi State for their invaluable contributions in the fields of charity and public welfare. The establishment of Sheth G.C. High School stands as a shining example of their vision to uplift society through knowledge and service.</p>
